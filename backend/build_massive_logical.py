def generate_prompt(topic: str, difficulty: str) -> str:
    return f"""
    Generate exactly {BATCH_SIZE} unique, highly challenging multiple choice questions for the topic: {topic}.
    Difficulty: {difficulty}. Ensure these are placement-exam standard logical reasoning questions.
    
    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Return ONLY a valid JSON array.
    2. 'options' must be exactly 4 strings.
    3. 'answer' must EXACTLY MATCH one of the options.
    4. NO LATEX OR BACKSLASHES. Use standard text.
    5. DIALOGUE RULE: If a person is speaking (very common in Blood Relations), YOU MUST USE SINGLE QUOTES (' '). 
       ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBLE QUOTES (") ALLOWED INSIDE THE TEXT. Double quotes will break the JSON!
       Example of Good format: 'He is my brother's son.'
       Example of Bad format: "He is my brother's son."
    6. 'explanation' MUST be formatted with exact headers "*Standard method*:" and "*SHORTCUT Trick*:". 
    7. In the 'explanation', you MUST insert a newline character (\\n) after EACH full stop (.) so every sentence/step is on a new line.
    
    Format:
    [
      {{
        "module": "{MODULE_NAME}",
        "topic": "{topic}",
        "difficulty": "{difficulty}",
        "question": "Pointing to a photograph, a man said, 'I have no brother or sister but that man's father is my father's son.' Whose photograph was it?",
        "options": ["A. His own", "B. His son's", "C. His father's", "D. His nephew's"],
        "answer": "B. His son's",
        "explanation": "*Standard method*:\\nSince the narrator has no brother or sister, 'my father's son' refers to the narrator himself.\\nTherefore, the man in the photograph has the narrator as his father.\\nSo, the photograph is of his son.\\n\\n*SHORTCUT Trick*:\\nBreak it down backwards.\\n'My father's son' = Me (since no siblings).\\n'That man's father' = Me.\\nTherefore, 'That man' = My son.\\n"
